    "## Summary and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Regenerative cooling is a critical aspect of rocket engine design. This effectively addresses the challenge of managing extremely high temperatures generated during the combustion process involving the fuel and oxidizer. In this project, we analyze a regenerative rocket engine system that utilizes ethanol as both fuel and coolant, with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer initially. Then, we make a substantial improvement to the engine, using both the fuel and the oxidizer as a coolant by circulating them around the combustion chamber of the rocket engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem at hand is to design an efficient cooling circuit that can reliably maintain the structural integrity of the combustion chamber and nozzle walls, whilst maximizing engine performance. Without appropriate thermal management, the immense heat from combustion could potentially severely damage, if not melt, the engine components, leading to a catastrophic and incredibly expensive failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regenerative cooling offers an elegant solution by routing the fuel through cooling channels in the chamber walls prior to injection. This process serves two crucial functions:\n",
    "1. It absorbs heat from the combustion chamber, preventing overheating of the walls.\n",
    "2. It preheats the fuel, improving combustion efficiency upon injection.\n"

    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regenerative rocket engine design, we utilize ethanol as the fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer. This propellant combination offers several advantages, including low toxicity, room temperature storability, and high energy density. The engine system consists of separate storage tanks for the fuel and oxidizer, connected to the combustion chamber via pumps. The ethanol tank is pressurized to 300 kPa, while the injector feed pressure is set at 1.2 MPa. The fuel and oxidizer mass flow rates are both 0.125 kg/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the combustion chamber, the fuel and oxidizer mix and ignite, producing high-temperature, high-pressure gases. These gases then expand through a convergent-divergent nozzle, accelerating to supersonic speeds and generating thrust.\n",
    "The nozzle design is critical for optimizing thrust. The converging section accelerates the subsonic flow to sonic speed at the throat, while the diverging section further accelerates the supersonic flow. The nozzle's shape and exit area are carefully designed to maximize thrust and efficiency by ensuring optimal gas expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Assumptions\n",
    "#### Pump\n",
    "- Isentropic\n",
    "- Isothermal\n",
    "#### Fluid\n",
    "- Inviscid\n",
    "- No pressure loss due to turbulent flow\n",
    "#### Heat \n",
    "- Isobaric addition\n",
    "- 5% heat rejection through walls\n",
    "- We assume the combustion chamber walls will melt at some point if the heat addition due to combustion is greater than heat being rejected through the walls. To ensure that the combustion chamber does not melt, we calculate the necessary changes in enthalpy required to absorb all of the heat rejected through the walls from the combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Values\n",
    "- 1.2 MPa is feed pressure for Injectors\n",
    "- 300 kPa is tank pressure\n",
    "- Fuel and Oxidizers are saturated liquids when injected (Given they must be liquid, saturated maximizes ability to absorb heat)\n",
    "- Ethanol and oxygen mass flow rates of 0.125 kg/second\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The improvement we made to the regenerative rocket engine design, specifically routing the fuel as well as the oxidizer, instead of just the fuel, around the combustion chamber, enabled the ethanol to be stored at a much more reasonable temperature in the storage tank. In the preliminary design, the ethanol needed to be stored at -114°C to ensure it could appropriately and sufficiently absorb all of the combustion chamber’s heat. By using the oxidizer, ethanol needs to be stored at a temperature of 50°C, which is substantially more reasonable than the previous scenario. This design change not only improves the operational efficiency of the engine but also reduces the complexity and energy requirements for cryogenic storage systems. Higher storage temperatures for the ethanol result in a less demanding cryogenic setup, potentially reducing system mass and operational costs.\n"
